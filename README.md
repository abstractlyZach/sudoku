# sudoku
I'm working on this project with Ryan Aveo https://github.com/ryanaveo/ to improve our programming skills. 
We each have our own implementations of the code, but we're writing them with the same requirements. Check out his code here:
* https://github.com/ryanaveo/sudoku
## Road Map:
1. Write comprehensive unit tests.
1. Write game logic.
1. Write out-of-game functions for utilities like saving and loading games.
1. Create a command line interface to play sudoku.
1. Create a GUI to play sudoku.
1. Create an AI that solves sudoku using our own ideas.
1. Implement and AI that solves sudoku using a given algorithm.

## Possible extra features:
1. A sudoku suggester that will suggest a next move and give you the explanation.
1. A version of sudoku that allows you to write in the little numbers in the corners like some other applications let you do.
